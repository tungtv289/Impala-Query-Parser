# Impala query parser
Welcome to the code example for the Impala Query Parser project. This project focuses on creating a parser for Impala queries to enable efficient processing and analysis of SQL queries written for the Apache Impala.


Getting Started: To get started with the Impala Query Parser, follow these steps:

Installation: Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed. Import clouldera_lib + impala_lib or build this library you need to create a local build of Apache Impala.

Usage: Provide clear instructions on how to integrate the parser into existing projects or use it for analyzing Impala queries.

Examples: Include sample code snippets or example queries to demonstrate the usage of the parser and showcase its capabilities.

```shell
java -cp ./target/impala_parser.jar:./clouldera_lib/*:./impala_lib/* dev.impala.Example
```
